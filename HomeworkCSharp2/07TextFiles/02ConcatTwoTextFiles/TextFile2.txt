		SECOND FILE
4. Write a program that compares two text files line by line and prints the number of lines that 
	are the same and the number of lines that are different. Assume the files have equal number 
	of lines.
5. Write a program that reads a text file containing a square matrix of numbers and finds in the 
	matrix an area of size 2 x 2 with a maximal sum of its elements. The first line in the input 
	file contains the size of matrix N. Each of the next N lines contain N numbers separated by 
	space. The output should be a single number in a separate text file.
