Of the different methods that purport to measure intelligence, the most famous is
the IQ (Intelligence Quotient) test, which is a standardized test designed to measure
human intelligence as distinct from attainments.
Intelligence quotient is an age-related measure of intelligence level. The word
quotient means the result of dividing one quantity by another, and one definition of
intelligence is mental ability or quickness of mind.
Usually, IQ tests consist of a graded series of tasks, each of which has been standardized
with a large representative population of individuals in order to establish
an average IQ of 100 for each test.
It is generally accepted that a person’s mental ability develops at a constant rate
until about the age of 13, after which development has been shown to slow down,
and beyond the age of 18 little or no improvement is found.
